# Last Will And Testament 
## Yaroslav Shirokov

I, Yaroslav Shirokov, of San Francisco, California, remove my former Wills and Codicils and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament.

### Payment of Debts and Expenses

Default on any debt that is possible.

### Everything else

Any funds that remain after my death and final expenses should be used to construct the largest possible statue of
me fighting a bear with my bare hands and a knife, in the nude, and winning. Ideally cast in bronze, or chiseled from marble as expenses allow. Costs, if any are required, must include **permanent** placement of the monument.

Upon absolute and repeated failure to construct the statue, any money and instruments that could me made fluid should be converted to cash and considered **remaining money**.

Bury me with any **remaining money**. 

### My things

Drew Oliner, as my coolest fake father, should get _all_ my racing gear, and anything that goes fast including PCs, Drones, Bikes, and VR gear.

Mike Skalnik, as my greatest fake father, should get my television, wearables, and all Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and any other cryptocurrency that I own.

Katy Oliner or Katy Shirokov depending on the current name-change status at the time of my death, as the best sister I've ever had, should receive my book collection in its entirety, including any possible electronic copies, along with any remaining beer that I have left behind even though I don't drink at home, my treasure chest and its contents, and ops/dictator status to #a.

Christian Jensen, co-worker at Scribd, shall receive any combination of stock or stock options not to exceed $(700 * the value of Pi * the multiplier of Canadian to US currency at the exact time of death) to the nearest cent in United States currency.

Joshua Cooper, my best friend, shall receive my complete remains, including any and all belongings I am buried with.
